How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

If there is a difference between two versions of a file, there may exists a bug during the process of the revision. I focuses on the differences to identify the bugs that may occur there.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I can roll back at any time to any version that has been proved to be correct. On the basis of that, I can make revision to the file to identify a single bug among the others.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros for Git way: only the versions that have been proved to be or deemed as correct are committed, which can ensure most versions are correct.
cons for Git way: some of the flahes may be 
pros for Google docs: stores any version for future use.
cons for Google docs: too many versions in Google drive make wastation.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Except for its version control capacity, Google Docs is also a online document editing system, so I am not sure why.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
